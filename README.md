# Unethical Web Analytics Blocklist

An aggregated filter list containing CNAME cloaked trackers used by services that won't ask for your consent before collecting your personal data.

This blocklist deters trackers used by the following services:
* Fathom Analytics
* Plausible Analytics
* Simple Analytics.

This filter list is provided to be used with web browsers that don't provide ad-blockers with access to DNS queries. As far as I'm aware, that's everything besides Firefox.
